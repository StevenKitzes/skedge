# Skedge
An app to help you schedule stuff with other busy people.

## Version 1.0.0

First major version release (casual though it may be).  All features are considered complete, though so minor, non-functional bugs exist.

### Version 1.1.0

- App version is now included in the footer of the page, so that it will be more clear which changes you can expect to see reflected in the iteration of the proejct you're viewing.
- Test fix for QR code SVG unselectability on iOS.

### Version 1.2.0

- Revert expandable QR changes
- Refactor to TS
